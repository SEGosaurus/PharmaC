                        <p class="p1">At first, Anthony was a shy and quiet boy. As he grew up, he not only started to grow his majestic beard, but he increased his knowledge related to the pharmacy world. He noticed that people did not have time to wait in line in order to get their prescriptions and thus, the idea of <strong>Pharama</strong><b>C</b> was born. Anthony has dedicated a lot of time for this project which has lead to his election as <b>CEO</b> of <b>SEGosaurus</b>.</p>

Bijan is responsible for adding personal touches to the images seen on our website and creating the color template.</p>
