                        <p><strong>PharmaC</strong> is an application that connects individual pharmacies with their customers. It comes in two parts: a mobile app on the end of the customers, and a desktop/server application on the end of the pharmacy owners/managers. <br /><br />The <strong>PharmaC</strong> mobile application displays the stores weekly flyers, notifies users when their prescription has been filled, gives other information about their prescriptions and allows users to order a refill with the touch of a button. Users can also call the pharmacy from the app. <br /><br />The server side application hosts all user information, handles notifications and allows stores to update their flyers.</p>
