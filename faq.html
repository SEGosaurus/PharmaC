                        <h3>What is <strong>PharmaC?</strong></h3>

                    <div class="answer">
                        <p><strong>PharmaC</strong> is an application that connects individual pharmacies with their customers. It comes in two parts: a <em>mobile app</em> on the end of the customers, and a <em>desktop/server application</em> on the end of the pharmacy owners/managers. <br /><br />The <strong>PharmaC</strong> <em>mobile application</em> displays the stores weekly flyers, notifies users when their prescription has been filled, gives other information about their prescriptions and allows users to order a refill with the touch of a button. Users can also call the pharmacy from the app. <br /><br />The <em>server side application</em> hosts all user information, handles notifications and allows stores to update their flyers.</p>
