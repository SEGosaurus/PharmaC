Overall Feel
============

The overall feel of the site should begin with a subtle and calm looking landing page. This will grab the users
attention right off the bat and attract them with the minimalist look. The main button will then redirect them 
to the home page which is a scrolling dynamic website page with brief summary sections of each page. This page is
more content-filled.

Iconography
============
The icons for the website will be a similar looking minimalist look, similar to that of any Google product.
Icons can be taken from several icon archive's online.

Typography
============
As the primary font, we will be using Open Sans. Title's may vary (different title fonts)

Links
============
Links change colour, and do not have underlines (they are not modern). Their colour will be a tint of the page's most
predominant colour.

Buttons
============
Buttons will use complimentary and non-contrasting colours for regular buttons, but they will use the emphasized colours
for majority of the buttons on the website.
